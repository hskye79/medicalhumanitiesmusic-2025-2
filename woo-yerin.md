# La Traviata

The opera 'La Traviata' was composed by Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). Violetta, a popular ballerina in high society, falls in love with Alfredo. Their relationship is marred by social prejudice and Alfredo's father's opposition. Ultimately, Violetta sacrifices herself for Alfredo's family by breaking up with him, ultimately dying of tuberculosis. They are reunited, but Alfredo's death forces him to belatedly realize his true feelings. 

Given Violetta's thin build, pale skin, coughing, hemoptysis, and general weakness before her death, the likely cause of her death is pulmonary tuberculosis. Throughout the story, Violetta displays pale skin, a thin build, frequent coughing and hemoptysis, and a listless appearance, gradually weakening. "La Traviata" actively utilizes melody, instrumentation, tempo, and key changes to musically delicately express the pain of illness. In Act 3, "Addio del passato" (Goodbye, Yesterday), the slow tempo, low register, and weeping oboe melody deeply express Violetta's agony, despair, and resignation as she faces death. Violetta's arias in Acts 2 and 3 directly reveal her frail body and the pain of her illness with their short breaths, monotonous rhythms, and disjointed phrasing. Violetta's incurable illness symbolizes the social alienation and anxiety of 19th-century Parisian society women, especially those of lower classes. Her illness and death encapsulate the fate of women who are victims of social norms and prejudice, relegated to the margins of society.
