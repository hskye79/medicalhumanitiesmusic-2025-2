  The singer realizes they are gradually forgetting their loved one.
  Memories still linger, along with traces of longing and worry.
  They wish for the other’s happiness, not wanting their own sadness to cause more pain.
  Ultimately, by saying “Please forget me,” they accept parting as an act of love for both.
* Plot summary:
  Cheol-su, a construction site manager, and Su-jin, a fashion designer, fall in love and get married.

3. Reflection on how the music portrays the illness or disability
   Please Forget Me captures the emotional state of a woman who begins to forget even the person she loves because of Alzheimer’s disease. The gentle piano and slow tempo symbolize the gradual blurring of her memories, while the repeated melody reflects fleeting moments of recollection. The line “I think I’m slowly forgetting you now” directly expresses the progression of the illness, and the music conveys the sorrow and tenderness of losing one’s memories yet holding onto love.
