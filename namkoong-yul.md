# The Classic

In <The Classic>(2003), directed by Jae-yong Kwak, used the music <The More I Love You>, sung by Sung Min Han. Through the lyrics, the pain of the male protagonist who cannot be achieved with his loved one is captured when he returns after losing his sight while dispatching troops to Vietnam. "I can't see you, but I can't erase you" I can't see my beloved lover because I lost my sight, but I can't erase the memories of the past, so it can be seen as a lyric that expresses the emotions of the male protagonist who only accumulates longing.
