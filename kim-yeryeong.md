# me before you

The film Me Before You, based on Jojo Moyes' novel, features a soundtrack that delicately supports the emotional journey of Will Traynor, a wealthy quadriplegic, and Louisa Clark, his quirky caregiver. Key tracks include "Unsteady (Erich Lee Gravity Remix)" by X Ambassadors, which provides a stripped-down, string-laden version of the original to underscore the film's poignant moments, particularly those dealing with Will's internal struggle. The lyrics—“Hold, hold on, hold onto me / 'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady”—poignantly capture a feeling of vulnerability and the desperate need for support, which can be interpreted as Will's plea for emotional stability amidst his physical limitations. Another significant track is "Till The End" by Jessie Ware, an uplifting yet tender love song often heard as Will and Louisa's relationship deepens, with lyrics like “When everything is crazy / You find a way to make it right” reflecting Louisa's effect on Will's cynical outlook. The soundtrack also features "Surprise Yourself" by Jack Garratt, matching Louisa’s vibrant and optimistic energy. Will Traynor, a successful banker, is left a quadriplegic after an accident two years prior and has since become cynical and withdrawn. Louisa Clark, an eccentric and bright young woman, is hired as his temporary caregiver. Despite initial friction, Lou’s persistent cheerfulness gradually breaks through Will’s emotional defenses, and the two fall in love. The central conflict arises when Lou learns of Will’s plan to end his life with dignity at an assisted suicide facility, forcing her to confront the limits of love and choice.

The music in Me Before You avoids a direct or simplistic portrayal of Will’s physical disability (quadriplegia). Instead, the soundtrack focuses on the emotional landscape created by his condition, primarily emphasizing his grief, isolation, and the transformative hope he finds in his relationship with Louisa. The melancholic yet warm tones of tracks like "Unsteady (Erich Lee Gravity Remix)" serve as a powerful metaphor for his inner turmoil and the profound dependency he experiences, while also highlighting the fragility of human connection. By focusing on themes of love, loss, and the right to dignity over a clinical depiction of his physical state, the music subtly encourages the audience to empathize with Will's emotional journey and his challenging ultimate decision, rather than merely focusing on his paralysis.
